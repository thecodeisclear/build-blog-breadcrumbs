Build Blog Breadcrumbs
======================

## Description
Build Blog Breadcrumbs is a wordpress plugin to create a breadcrumb trail on posts and pages. Plugin options allow you to specify how the breadcrumb is displayed (location, shortest/longest path), etc. 

## Working Notes
I am trying an Agile approach to build this plugin, in the sense that each time I commit to the repo, it will be a potentially usable product. It might not do everything that the description says, but you will be able to atleast install it on your site with no major errors. If you find any errors, please raise an issue on GitHub and deactivate the plugin till a resolution is found.

## Version History
- **v0.1** : When activated, the plugin will show a breadcrumb below the post title when the post is viewed standalone. The text is surrounded by a border to distinguish it from the rest of the content and the breadcrumb text is 66% of the content/post text.
